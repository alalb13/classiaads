Classiads App. Backend part.<br>
The views were created to test for correct operation.<br>
The App contains a registration part per user.<br>
Each user can publish their ad with only one image.<br>
Each user can choose the category of the ad.<br>
Each user has their own Dashboard to edit or delete ads.<br>
The Home can be viewed without registering and contains announcements from all users.<br>
If a user opens his own ad from the Home, he will still be able to view the buttons (edit and delete).<br>

I hope it will be useful.<br>
